      This will contain the actual questions and answers. At the moment I&apos;m
      thinking just hard coded questions with simple input validation to keep it
      simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we&apos;ll need to record the answers to keep the
      leaderboard up to date across devices. (Firebase makes this super simple,
      they don&apos;t even need to refresh the page.)
